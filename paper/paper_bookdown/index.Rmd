# Abstract

DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression and plays a crucial role in how plants respond to environmental changes. This paper investigates DNA methylation patterns in *Arabidopsis thaliana* and their relationship to environmental variation, with a particular focus on temperature. We analyze methylation data from globally distributed *A. thaliana* accessions grown under different temperature conditions.

To quantify differences in methylation patterns, we apply Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) as the primary analytical framework. This allows us to identify genomic sites and regions with varying levels of methylation diversity across environmental conditions.

The analysis considers three methylation contexts—CpG, CHG, and CHH—which differ in their biological roles and genomic distributions. By examining these contexts separately, we aim to uncover context-specific patterns of epigenetic regulation in response to temperature.

Ultimately, this study seeks to identify genomic regions exhibiting temperature-associated methylation divergence, contributing to our understanding of epigenetic plasticity and climate adaptation in plants.
