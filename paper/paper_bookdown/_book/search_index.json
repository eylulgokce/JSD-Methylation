This paper investigates DNA methylation patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana and their relationship to environmental variation, with a particular focus on temperature. We analyze methylation data from globally distributed A. thaliana accessions grown under different temperature conditions. To quantify differences in methylation patterns, we apply Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) as the primary analytical framework. This allows us to identify genomic sites and regions with varying levels of methylation diversity across environmental conditions. The analysis considers three methylation contexts—CpG, CHG, and CHH—which differ in their biological roles and genomic distributions. By examining these contexts separately, we aim to uncover context-specific patterns of epigenetic regulation in response to temperature. Ultimately, this study seeks to identify genomic regions exhibiting temperature-associated methylation divergence, contributing to our understanding of epigenetic plasticity and climate adaptation in plants.

DNA methylation, a biochemical mark involving the addition of a methyl group to cytosine bases, plays an important role in shaping gene expression, maintaining genome stability, and silencing transposable elements (Law and Jacobsen 2010; Slotkin and Martienssen 2007).Understanding these mechanisms is essential for dissecting how epigenetic marks evolve and vary across populations. In plants, DNA methylation is more complex than in mammals. It occurs in three sequence contexts: CG, CHG, and CHH (where H = A, T, or C), each maintained by different enzymatic pathways (Law and Jacobsen 2010). For instance, CG methylation is maintained by MET1, CHG by CMT3, and CHH methylation, often found in transposable elements, is established de novo by the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway (Slotkin and Martienssen 2007). These patterns are not only vital for gene regulation but are also tightly linked to developmental processes and stress responses (Lister et al. 2008; Lämke and Bäurle 2017). Large-scale efforts such as the 1001 Epigenomes Project (Kawakatsu et al. 2016) have mapped DNA methylation at single-base resolution across Arabidopsis thaliana accessions using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). This method relies on sodium bisulfite treatment, which converts unmethylated cytosines to uracil while leaving methylated cytosines unchanged, enabling the precise detection of methylation states at cytosine residues (Cokus et al. 2008; Lister et al. 2008). These resources allow researchers to study methylation variability across populations and to identify loci with stable versus dynamic methylation states. Such variation has been linked to adaptive traits (Schmid et al. 2018), indicating that DNA methylation could act as a substrate for natural selection. Despite this growing interest, tools to quantify epigenomic diversity across individuals have lagged behind those used in genetics. In their study, Kartal et al. (Kartal, Schmid, and Grossniklaus 2019) noted that while population genetics commonly uses metrics such as FST to detect genomic regions under selection or differentiation (Holsinger and Weir 2009), these approaches are not well-suited to capture the continuous and multi-sample nature of methylation data. To address this, they introduced Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD) as a threshold-free, information-theoretic measure to quantify methylation divergence across samples. JSD is symmetric and bounded, and it reflects how much the methylation distribution at a given site varies across individuals. In practical terms, cytosines that are consistently methylated or unmethylated across samples have low JSD, whereas cytosines with variable methylation states exhibit high JSD. This makes it possible to scan the genome for divergent epigenetic loci without requiring parametric assumptions. The strength of JSD lies in its flexibility: it can be applied to methylation data from tissues, cell types, or populations. When combined with methylation rate (MET), JSD can also reveal biologically meaningful site categories that reflect both stability and variability in epigenetic regulation (Kartal, Schmid, and Grossniklaus 2019). Specifically, we define the following categories: LMC (Lowly Methylated Cytosines): MET &lt; 0.2 HMC (Highly Methylated Cytosines): MET &gt; 0.8 MMC (Mid-Methylated Cytosines): MET between 0.2 and 0.8, JSD ≤ 0.7 MSC (Metastable Cytosines): MET between 0.2 and 0.8, JSD &gt; 0.7 These site categories help distinguish between constitutive methylation patterns (LMC and HMC) and more variable or potentially regulatory ones (MMC and MSC). In particular, MSC sites may reflect epigenetic plasticity, stochastic switching or environmental responsiveness (Kartal, Schmid, and Grossniklaus 2019). While JSD identifies divergent loci, further analysis is needed to determine their regulatory or adaptive significance. Transposable elements (TEs), which make up a significant portion of the Arabidopsis genome, are a primary target of DNA methylation and silencing mechanisms (Slotkin and Martienssen 2007). The methylation of TEs is not only critical for suppressing their potential mobility but also for safeguarding nearby gene regulation. Previous studies have shown that TEs are hotspots of epigenetic variability, making them informative targets for studying methylation divergence across populations (zhang_genome?; Kartal, Schmid, and Grossniklaus 2019). In this study, we use whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data from the 1001 Epigenomes Project (Kawakatsu et al. 2016), which profiled DNA methylation across hundreds of A. thaliana accessions originating from diverse geographic and climatic backgrounds. This global sampling allows us to investigate methylation divergence across natural populations with broad environmental relevance. To quantify divergence, we adopt the same Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD) approach introduced by Kartal et al. (Kartal, Schmid, and Grossniklaus 2019), which we re-implemented in R. This method allows us to scan the genome for cytosines that show high methylation variability across accessions. We apply it across all three context types (CG, CHG, CHH) to ensure a comprehensive view of methylome dynamics. By focusing on TEs and their flanking regions, we aim to better understand how epigenomic diversity is structured across the genome and potentially linked to adaptation and gene regulation. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;figures/fig1.png&quot;) Figure 2.1: (A) Geographic distribution of Arabidopsis accessions from the 1001 Epigenomes Project.

It is derived from Shannon entropy (Shannon1948?) and has favorable properties such as symmetry and boundedness, making it useful for biological applications. In the context of genomics, JSD has been used to characterize variability in symbolic sequences (Grosse2002?) and more recently adapted for site-level methylation analysis (Kartal2020?). To estimate methylation divergence across samples, we followed the empirical, non-parametric approach of (Kartal2020?), applying a plug-in estimator to site-wise methylation counts. Each cytosine site was treated as a binary outcome (methylated or unmethylated), and per-sample read counts were used to compute empirical distributions and sample weights. For each genomic position \\( i \\), the JSD is calculated as: \\[ D_i = H\\left( \\sum_j \\pi_{ij} P_{ij} \\right) - \\sum_j \\pi_{ij} H(P_{ij}) \\] where: \\( P_{ij} = \\frac{1}{n_{ij}} (n_{ij1}, n_{ij2}) \\) represents the proportion of methylated (\\( n_{ij1} \\)) and unmethylated (\\( n_{ij2} \\)) reads for sample \\( j \\), \\( \\pi_{ij} = \\frac{n_{ij}}{n_i} \\) is the sample-specific weight based on total coverage, \\( n_i = \\sum_j n_{ij} \\) is the total number of reads across all samples at position \\( i \\), \\( H(P) = -\\sum_k P_k \\log_2 P_k \\) is the Shannon entropy in bits. The JSD takes values between 0 (no divergence) and 1 (maximum divergence for binary distributions).To avoid numerical instability caused by zero-probability entries, we followed the strategy described by (Kartal2020?), which avoids undefined entropy terms without applying averaging. Our implementation closely followed the algorithmic structure proposed in (Kartal2020?). Vectorized operations ensured that the computation scaled to thousands of methylomes and millions of genomic sites. 4.2 Data Preprocessing (Methylator Framework) To prepare the DNA methylation data for analysis, we used the Methylator framework developed in the lab of Prof. Ueli Grossniklaus. This pipeline integrates quality control, preprocessing, alignment, and methylation calling to ensure consistency and high-quality results across large-scale bisulfite sequencing datasets. Sequencing reads were initially retrieved from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), and sample metadata were curated to maintain consistency across accessions. The raw reads underwent quality assessment using FastQC, which evaluated sequencing quality metrics such as per-base quality scores, sequence duplication levels, and GC content. Reads failing to meet quality thresholds were then processed using TrimGalore, which removes low-quality bases (Q &lt; 30), sequencing adapters, and undetected nucleotides (Ns). To further refine the data, duplicate reads were filtered out, and for samples with multiple sequencing runs, all reads were merged using Clumpify. The cleaned reads were then aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana TAIR10 reference genome using Bismark, employing a two-step alignment strategy within the “Dirty-Harry” module of the Methylator framework. First, an end-to-end alignment was attempted for all reads. Reads that failed this initial alignment were then realigned using a local alignment mode. Methylation calls were generated for both alignment sets and subsequently merged to create a comprehensive methylation profile for each sample. Following alignment and methylation calling, the resulting data were post-processed to ensure completeness and coverage consistency. Samples with insufficient coverage or inconsistent methylation patterns were flagged for exclusion. Finally, all methylomes were harmonized by intersecting cytosine positions across samples, enabling accurate and site-resolved divergence analysis. 4.3 Data Analysis All downstream analyses were performed in Python and R, using a combination of custom scripts and established libraries. Statistical summaries, JSD phase plots, and enrichment analyses were performed with vectorized data structures, plotting libraries, and genomic toolkits.
