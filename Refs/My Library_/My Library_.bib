Estimates of F(ST) can identify regions of the genome that have been the target of selection, and comparisons of F(ST) from different parts of the genome can provide insights into the demographic history of populations. For these reasons and others, F(ST) has a central role in population and evolutionary genetics and has wide applications in fields that range from disease association mapping to forensic science. This Review clarifies how F(ST) is defined, how it should be estimated, how it is related to similar statistics and how estimates of F(ST) should be interpreted.},

	abstract = {The modulation of DNA-protein interactions by methylation of protein-binding sites in DNA and the occurrence in genomic imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, and fragile X syndrome of different methylation patterns in DNA of different chromosomal origin have underlined the need to establish methylation patterns in individual strands of particular genomic sequences. We report a genomic sequencing method that provides positive identification of 5-methylcytosine residues and yields strand-specific sequences of individual molecules in genomic DNA. The method utilizes bisulfite-induced modification of genomic DNA, under conditions whereby cytosine is converted to uracil, but 5-methylcytosine remains nonreactive. The sequence under investigation is then amplified by PCR with two sets of strand-specific primers to yield a pair of fragments, one from each strand, in which all uracil and thymine residues have been amplified as thymine and only 5-methylcytosine residues have been amplified as cytosine. The PCR products can be sequenced directly to provide a strand-specific average sequence for the population of molecules or can be cloned and sequenced to provide methylation maps of single DNA molecules. We tested the method by defining the methylation status within single DNA strands of two closely spaced CpG dinucleotides in the promoter of the human kininogen gene. During the analysis, we encountered in sperm DNA an unusual methylation pattern, which suggests that the high methylation level of single-copy sequences in sperm may be locally modulated by binding of protein factors in germ-line cells.},

In flowering plants, the specification of cells destined to enter meiosis occurs late in development, gametic and accessory cells are usually derived from the same meiotic product, and two distinct female gametes involved in double fertilization differentiate. This poses fascinating questions in terms of gamete development and the associated epigenetic processes. Although studies in this area remain at their infancy, it becomes clear that large-scale epigenetic reprograming, involving RNA-directed DNA methylation, chromatin modifications, and nucleosome remodeling, contributes to the establishment of transcriptionally repressive or permissive epigenetic landscapes. Furthermore, a role for small RNAs in the regulation of transposable elements during gametogenesis is emerging.},

ES cell lines homozygous for the mutation were generated by consecutive targeting of both wild-type alleles; the mutant cells were viable and showed no obvious abnormalities with respect to growth rate or morphology, and had only trace levels of DNA methyltransferase activity. A quantitative end-labeling assay showed that the level of m5C in the DNA of homozygous mutant cells was about one-third that of wild-type cells, and Southern blot analysis after cleavage of the DNA with a methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease revealed substantial demethylation of endogenous retroviral DNA. The mutation was introduced into the germline of mice and found to cause a recessive lethal phenotype. Homozygous embryos were stunted, delayed in development, and did not survive past midgestation. The DNA of homozygous embryos showed a reduction of the level of m5C similar to that of homozygous ES cells. These results indicate that while a 3-fold reduction in levels of genomic m5C has no detectable effect on the viability or proliferation of ES cells in culture, a similar reduction of DNA methylation in embryos causes abnormal development and embryonic lethality.},

We examined a population of recombinant inbred lines with epigenetically mosaic chromosomes consisting of wild-type and CG methylation-depleted segments (epiRILs). Surprisingly, transposons that were immobile in the parental lines displayed stochastic movement in 28\% of the epiRILs. Although analysis after eight generations of inbreeding, supported by genome-wide DNA methylation profiling, identified recombined parental chromosomal segments, these were interspersed with unexpectedly high frequencies of nonparental methylation polymorphism. Hence, epigenetic inheritance in hybrids derived from parents with divergent epigenomes permits long-lasting epi-allelic interactions that violate Mendelian expectations. Such persistently “unstable” epigenetic states complicate linkage-based epigenomic mapping. Thus, future epigenomic analyses should consider possible genetic instabilities and alternative mapping strategies.},

	abstract = {Epigenetics is receiving growing attention in the plant science community. Epigenetic modifications are thought to play a particularly important role in fluctuating environments. It is hypothesized that epigenetics contributes to plant phenotypic plasticity because epigenetic modifications, in contrast to DNA sequence variation, are more likely to be reversible. The population of decrease in DNA methylation 1-2 (ddm1-2)-derived epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs) in Arabidopsis thaliana is well suited for studying this hypothesis, as DNA methylation differences are maximized and DNA sequence variation is minimized. Here, we report on the extensive heritable epigenetic variation in plant growth and morphology in neutral and saline conditions detected among the epiRILs. Plant performance, in terms of branching and leaf area, was both reduced and enhanced by different quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in the ddm1-2 inherited epigenotypes. The variation in plasticity associated significantly with certain genomic regions in which the ddm1-2 inherited epigenotypes caused an increased sensitivity to environmental changes, probably due to impaired genetic regulation in the epiRILs. Many of the QTLs for morphology and plasticity overlapped, suggesting major pleiotropic effects. These findings indicate that epigenetics contributes substantially to variation in plant growth, morphology, and plasticity, especially under stress conditions.},

Simulating selection in a rapidly changing environment, we compare phenotypic traits and epigenetic variation between Arabidopsis thaliana populations grown for five generations under selection and their genetically nearly identical ancestors. Selected populations of two distinct genotypes show significant differences in flowering time and plant architecture, which are maintained for at least 2–3 generations in the absence of selection. While we cannot detect consistent genetic changes, we observe a reduction of epigenetic diversity and changes in the methylation state of about 50,000 cytosines, some of which are associated with phenotypic changes. Thus, we propose that epigenetic variation is subject to selection and can contribute to rapid adaptive responses, although the extent to which epigenetics plays a role in adaptation is still unclear.},

Here we review how the field has evolved over the last few decades and reflect on some of the recent advances that are changing our understanding of biology. We discuss the interplay between epigenetics and DNA sequence variation as well as the implications of epigenetics for cellular memory and plasticity. We consider the effects of the environment and both intergenerational and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance on biology, disease and evolution. Finally, we present some new frontiers in epigenetics with implications for human health.},

Changes in DNA methylation can produce meiotically stable epialleles that affect transcription and morphology, but the rates of spontaneous gain or loss of DNA methylation are unknown. We examined spontaneously occurring variation in DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana plants propagated by single-seed descent for 30 generations. We identified 114,287 CG single methylation polymorphisms and 2485 CG differentially methylated regions (DMRs), both of which show patterns of divergence compared with the ancestral state. Thus, transgenerational epigenetic variation in DNA methylation may generate new allelic states that alter transcription, providing a mechanism for phenotypic diversity in the absence of genetic mutation.},

This comparison of genome-wide DNA methylation among 10 Arabidopsis thaliana lines, derived from a common ancestor and maintained for 30 generations, shows that the methylation status of individual bases is dynamic. Hundreds of thousands of differentially methylated cytosines are generated, but wholesale changes of blocks of methylated cytosines — which have been linked to changes in gene expression and phenotypic differences — are rare and not random.

	abstract = {Loss or gain of DNA methylation can affect gene expression and is sometimes transmitted across generations. Such epigenetic alterations are thus a possible source of heritable phenotypic variation in the absence of DNA sequence change. However, attempts to assess the prevalence of stable epigenetic variation in natural and experimental populations and to quantify its impact on complex traits have been hampered by the confounding effects of DNA sequence polymorphisms. To overcome this problem as much as possible, two parents with little DNA sequence differences, but contrasting DNA methylation profiles, were used to derive a panel of epigenetic Recombinant Inbred Lines (epiRILs) in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The epiRILs showed variation and high heritability for flowering time and plant height (∼30\%), as well as stable inheritance of multiple parental DNA methylation variants (epialleles) over at least eight generations. These findings provide a first rationale to identify epiallelic variants that contribute to heritable variation in complex traits using linkage or association studies. More generally, the demonstration that numerous epialleles across the genome can be stable over many generations in the absence of selection or extensive DNA sequence variation highlights the need to integrate epigenetic information into population genetics studies.},

Here, we determined the landscape of Arabidopsis thaliana chromatin states using 16 features, including DNA sequence, CG methylation, histone variants, and modifications. The combinatorial complexity of chromatin can be reduced to nine states that describe chromatin with high resolution and robustness. Each chromatin state has a strong propensity to associate with a subset of other states defining a discrete number of chromatin motifs. These topographical relationships revealed that an intergenic state, characterized by H3K27me3 and slightly enriched in activation marks, physically separates the canonical Polycomb chromatin and two heterochromatin states from the rest of the euchromatin domains. Genomic elements are distinguished by specific chromatin states: four states span genes from transcriptional start sites (TSS) to termination sites and two contain regulatory regions upstream of TSS. Polycomb regions and the rest of the euchromatin can be connected by two major chromatin paths. Sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the occurrence of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 in the same chromatin fiber, within a two to three nucleosome size range. Our data provide insight into the Arabidopsis genome topography and the establishment of gene expression patterns, specification of DNA replication origins, and definition of chromatin domains.},

	abstract = {Systems biology, a holistic approach describing a system emerging from the interactions of its molecular components, critically depends on accurate qualitative determination and quantitative measurements of these components. Development and improvement of large-scale profiling methods ("omics") now facilitates comprehensive measurements of many relevant molecules. For multicellular organisms, such as animals, fungi, algae, and plants, the complexity of the system is augmented by the presence of specialized cell types and organs, and a complex interplay within and between them. Cell type-specific analyses are therefore crucial for the understanding of developmental processes and environmental responses. This review first gives an overview of current methods used for large-scale profiling of specific cell types exemplified by recent advances in plant biology. The focus then lies on suitable model systems to study plant development and cell type specification. We introduce the female gametophyte of flowering plants as an ideal model to study fundamental developmental processes. Moreover, the female reproductive lineage is of importance for the emergence of evolutionary novelties such as an unequal parental contribution to the tissue nurturing the embryo or the clonal production of seeds by asexual reproduction (apomixis). Understanding these processes is not only interesting from a developmental or evolutionary perspective, but bears great potential for further crop improvement and the simplification of breeding efforts. We finally highlight novel methods, which are already available or which will likely soon facilitate large-scale profiling of the specific cell types of the female gametophyte in both model and non-model species. We conclude that it may take only few years until an evolutionary systems biology approach toward female gametogenesis may decipher some of its biologically most interesting and economically most valuable processes.},

The specific regulation of different TEs, as well as their different roles in chromosome architecture and gene regulation, is specified by where on the chromosome the TE is located: near a gene, within a gene, in a pericentromere/TE island, or at the centromere core. In this Review, we investigate the silencing mechanisms responsible for inhibiting TE activity for each of these chromosomal contexts, emphasizing that chromosomal location is the first rule dictating the specific regulation of each TE.},

A comprehensive annotation of its genome paves the way for understanding the functions and activities of all types of transcripts, including mRNA, the various classes of non-coding RNA, and small RNA. The TAIR10 annotation update had a profound impact on Arabidopsis research but was released more than 5 years ago. Maintaining the accuracy of the annotation continues to be a prerequisite for future progress. Using an integrative annotation pipeline, we assembled tissue-specific RNA-Seq libraries from 113 datasets and constructed 48 359 transcript models of protein-coding genes in eleven tissues. In addition, we annotated various classes of non-coding RNA including microRNA, long intergenic RNA, small nucleolar RNA, natural antisense transcript, small nuclear RNA, and small RNA using published datasets and in-house analytic results. Altogether, we identified 635 novel protein-coding genes, 508 novel transcribed regions, 5178 non-coding RNAs, and 35 846 small RNA loci that were formerly unannotated. Analysis of the splicing events and RNA-Seq based expression profiles revealed the landscapes of gene structures, untranslated regions, and splicing activities to be more intricate than previously appreciated. Furthermore, we present 692 uniformly expressed housekeeping genes, 43\% of whose human orthologs are also housekeeping genes. This updated Arabidopsis genome annotation with a substantially increased resolution of gene models will not only further our understanding of the biological processes of this plant model but also of other species.},

However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner.Results: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.Availability and implementation: BEDTools was written in C++.

            Attention has recently focused on a basic yet unresolved problem in statistics: How can one quantify the strength of a statistical association between two variables without bias for relationships of a specific form? Here we propose a way of mathematically formalizing this “equitability” criterion, using core concepts from information theory. This criterion is naturally satisfied by a fundamental information-theoretic measure of dependence called “mutual information.” By contrast, a recently introduced dependence measure called the “maximal information coefficient” is seen to violate equitability. We conclude that estimating mutual information provides a natural and practical method for equitably quantifying associations in large datasets.

              How should one quantify the strength of association between two random variables without bias for relationships of a specific form? Despite its conceptual simplicity, this notion of statistical “equitability” has yet to receive a definitive mathematical formalization. Here we argue that equitability is properly formalized by a self-consistency condition closely related to Data Processing Inequality. Mutual information, a fundamental quantity in information theory, is shown to satisfy this equitability criterion. These findings are at odds with the recent work of Reshef et al. [Reshef DN, et al. (2011)
              Science
              334(6062):1518–1524], which proposed an alternative definition of equitability and introduced a new statistic, the “maximal information coefficient” (MIC), said to satisfy equitability in contradistinction to mutual information. These conclusions, however, were supported only with limited simulation evidence, not with mathematical arguments. Upon revisiting these claims, we prove that the mathematical definition of equitability proposed by Reshef et al. cannot be satisfied by any (nontrivial) dependence measure. We also identify artifacts in the reported simulation evidence. When these artifacts are removed, estimates of mutual information are found to be more equitable than estimates of MIC. Mutual information is also observed to have consistently higher statistical power than MIC. We conclude that estimating mutual information provides a natural (and often practical) way to equitably quantify statistical associations in large datasets.},

We show in this paper that there exist families of such divergences with the same consistent properties. Moreover, we establish links and correspondences among these divergences by applying suitable nonlinear transformations. For example, we can generate the Beta-divergences directly from Alpha-divergences and vice versa. Furthermore, we show that a new wide class of Gamma-divergences can be generated not only from the family of Beta-divergences but also from a family of Alpha-divergences. The paper bridges these divergences and shows also their links to Tsallis and Rényi entropies. Most of these divergences have a natural information theoretic interpretation.},

A unified concept of diversity is presented, according to which there is a continuum of possible diversity measures. In a sense which becomes apparent, these measures provide estimates of the effective number of species present, and differ only in their tendency to include or to ignore the relatively rarer species. The notion of the diversity of a community as opposed to that of a sample is examined, and is related to the asymptotic form of the species—abundance curve. A new and plausible definition of evenness is derived.},

Conversion of these to effective number of species is the key to a unified and intuitive interpretation of diversity. Effective numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a diversity, while raw indices do not. Contrary to Keylock, the lack of concavity of effective numbers of species is irrelevant as long as they are used as transformations of concave alpha, beta, and gamma entropies. The practical importance of this transformation is demonstrated by applying it to a popular community similarity measure based on raw diversity indices or entropies. The standard similarity measure based on untransformed indices is shown to give misleading results, but transforming the indices or entropies to effective numbers of species produces a stable, easily interpreted, sensitive general similarity measure. General overlap measures derived from this transformed similarity measure yield the Jaccard index, Sørensen index, Horn index of overlap, and the Morisita–Horn index as special cases.},

Assuming a complete random-effect model, a general ANOVA procedure is developed to estimate F-statistics as ratios of different variance components for all levels of population subdivision in the hierarchy. A generalized relationship among F-statistics is also derived to extend the well-known relationship originally found by Sewall Wright. Although not entirely free from the bias particular to small number of subdivisions at each hierarchy and extreme gene frequencies, the ANOVA estimators of F-statistics consider sampling effects at each level of hierarchy, thus removing the bias incurred in the other estimators that are commonly based on direct substitution of unknown gene frequencies by their sample estimates. Therefore, the ANOVA estimation procedure presented here may become increasingly useful in analyzing complex population structure because of increasing use of the estimated hierarchical F-statistics to infer genetic and demographic structures of natural populations within and among species.},

Recent advancements in sequencing technologies now enable us to generate high-throughput methylation data and to measure methylation up to single-base resolution. This wealth of data does not come without challenges, and one of the key challenges in DNA methylation studies is to identify the signiﬁcant differences in the methylation levels of the base pairs across distinct biological conditions. Several computational methods have been developed to identify differential methylation using bisulﬁte sequencing data; however, there is no clear consensus among existing approaches. A comprehensive survey of these approaches would be of great beneﬁt to potential users and researchers to get a complete picture of the available resources. In this article, we present a detailed survey of 22 such approaches focusing on their underlying statistical models, primary features, key advantages and major limitations.

	abstract = {Background
Variation in DNA methylation across distinct genetic populations, or in response to specific biotic or abiotic stimuli, has typically been studied in leaf DNA from pooled individuals using either reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) or methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP). The latter represents a useful alterative when sample size is large, or when analysing methylation changes in genomes that have yet to be sequenced. In this study we compared variation in methylation across ten individual leaf and endosperm samples from maize hybrid and inbred lines using MSAP. We also addressed the methodological implications of analysing methylation variation using pooled versus individual DNA samples, in addition to the validity of MSAP compared to WGBS. Finally, we analysed a subset of variable and non-variable fragments with respect to genomic location, vicinity to repetitive elements and expression patterns across leaf and endosperm tissues.

Results
On average, 30\% of individuals showed inter-individual methylation variation, mostly of leaf and endosperm-specific differentially methylated DNA regions. With the exception of low frequency demethylation events, the bulk of inter-individual methylation variation (84 and 80\% in leaf and endosperm, respectively) was effectively captured in DNA from pooled individuals. Furthermore, available genome-wide methylation data largely confirmed MSAP leaf methylation profiles. Most variable methylation that mapped within genes was associated with CG methylation, and many of such genes showed tissue-specific expression profiles. Finally, we found that the hAT DNA transposon was the most common class II transposable element found in close proximity to variable DNA regions.

Conclusions
The relevance of our results with respect to future studies of methylation variation is the following: firstly, the finding that inter-individual methylation variation is largely restricted to tissue-specific differentially methylated DNA regions, underlines the importance of tissue-type when analysing the methylation response to a defined stimulus. Secondly, we show that pooled sample-based MSAP studies are methodologically appropriate to study methylation variation. Thirdly, we confirm that MSAP is a powerful tool when WGBS is not required or feasible, for example in plant species that have yet to be sequenced.

Aberrations in placental DNA methylation are linked to several disease states, including intrauterine growth restriction and preeclampsia. Studying the evolution and development of the placental epigenome is critical to understanding the origin and progression of such diseases. Although high-resolution studies have found substantial variation between placental methylomes of different species, the nature of methylome variation has yet to be characterized within any individual species. We conducted a study of placental DNA methylation at high resolution in multiple strains and closely related species of house mice (Mus musculus musculus, Mus m. domesticus, and M. spretus), across developmental timepoints (embryonic days 15–18), and between two distinct layers (labyrinthine transport and junctional endocrine). We observed substantial genome-wide methylation heterogeneity in mouse placenta compared with other differentiated tissues. Species-speciﬁc methylation proﬁles were concentrated in retrotransposon subfamilies, speciﬁcally RLTR10 and RLTR20 subfamilies. Regulatory regions such as gene promoters and CpG islands displayed cross-species conservation, but showed strong differences between layers and developmental timepoints. Partially methylated domains exist in the mouse placenta and widen during development. Taken together, our results characterize the mouse placental methylome as a highly heterogeneous and deregulated landscape globally, intermixed with actively regulated promoter and retrotransposon sequences.},

However, neither the extent to which this occurs, nor the mechanisms involved are known. Here we investigate DNA methylation variation in Swedish Arabidopsis thaliana accessions grown at two different temperatures. Environmental effects were limited to transposons, where CHH methylation was found to increase with temperature. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed that the extensive CHH methylation variation was strongly associated with genetic variants in both cis and trans, including a major trans-association close to the DNA methyltransferase CMT2. Unlike CHH methylation, CpG gene body methylation (GBM) was not affected by growth temperature, but was instead correlated with the latitude of origin. Accessions from colder regions had higher levels of GBM for a significant fraction of the genome, and this was associated with increased transcription for the genes affected. GWAS revealed that this effect was largely due to trans-acting loci, many of which showed evidence of local adaptation.},

Here, we identified 23,095 TE presence/absence variants between 216 Arabidopsis accessions. Most TE variants were rare, and we find these rare variants associated with local extremes of gene expression and DNA methylation levels within the population. Of the common alleles identified, two thirds were not in linkage disequilibrium with nearby SNPs, implicating these variants as a source of novel genetic diversity. Many common TE variants were associated with significantly altered expression of nearby genes, and a major fraction of inter-accession DNA methylation differences were associated with nearby TE insertions. Overall, this demonstrates that TE variants are a rich source of genetic diversity that likely plays an important role in facilitating epigenomic and transcriptional differences between individuals, and indicates a strong genetic basis for epigenetic variation.},

The events for which bursts of TEs have been recorded include domestication, polyploidy, changes in mating systems, interspeciﬁc and intergeneric hybridization and abiotic stress. Cases involving abiotic stress, particularly bursts of TEs in natural populations driven by environmental change, are of special interest because this phenomenon may underlie micro- and macro-evolutionary events and ultimately support the maintenance and generation of biological diversity.

	abstract = {The epigenome modulates the activity of genes and supports the stability of the genome. The epigenome can also contain phenotypically relevant, heritable marks that may vary at the organismic and population level. Such non-genetic standing variation may be relevant to ecological and evolutionary processes. To identify loci susceptible to selection, it is common to profile large populations at the genome scale, yet methods to perform such scans for epigenetic diversity are barely tapped. Here, we develop a scalable, information-theoretic approach to assess epigenome diversity based on Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and demonstrate its practicality by measuring cell type-specific methylation diversity in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. DNA methylation diversity tends to be increased in the CG as compared to the non-CG (CHG and CHH) sequence context but the tissue or cell type has an impact on diversity at non-CG sites. Less accessible, more heterochromatic states of chromatin exhibit increased diversity. Genes tend to carry more single-methylation polymorphisms when they harbor gene body-like chromatin signatures and flank transposable elements (TEs). In conclusion, the analysis of DNA methylation with JSD in Arabidopsis demonstrates that the genomic location of a gene dominates its methylation diversity, in particular the proximity to TEs which are increasingly viewed as drivers of evolution. Importantly, the JSD-based approach we implemented here is applicable to any population-level epigenomic data set to analyze variation in epigenetic marks among individuals, tissues, or cells of any organism, including the epigenetic heterogeneity of cells in healthy or diseased organs such as tumors.},

High-density genotype data for A. thaliana, including those from the 1001 Genomes Project, were key to demonstrating the enormous power of GWAS in inbred populations of wild plants, and the comparison of intraspecific polymorphism with interspecific divergence has illuminated many aspects of plant genome evolution. Over the past decade, an increasing number of nearly complete genome sequences have been published for many more accessions.

	abstract = {Plant biologists need many completely sequenced and functionally annotated genomes within each species in order to fully exploit the power of evolution to understand how an organism functions and adapts to its environment. Researchers interested in natural variation in Arabidopsis propose to generate genomic DNA sequences from over 1000 inbred strains, driving technology developments in both hardware for the DNA sequencing itself and in software development to make sense of the DNA sequence data. The goal of this research project is to record the genetic variation in the entire genome of many strains of the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We will develop and apply cutting edge DNA sequencing approaches using the reference plant A. thaliana to address questions of fundamental importance about plant evolution and gene function. The complete genome sequences for 200 accessions, produced as a result of this project, will provide the first complete view of haplotype structure for Arabidopsis thaliana and will allow future studies of epigenetic variation among different individuals in a population or within a species, a potential source of phenotypic diversity. The patterns of sequence and structural variation will reveal important insights into the dynamics of genome change and pinpoint potentially functionally important sources of genetic and epigenetic variation. Moreover, these data will enable subsequent mechanistic studies through experimental manipulation of Arabidopsis strains. The 1001 Arabidopsis Genomes Project (http://1001genomes.org) will provide detailed genotyping data of wild strains that will complement the efforts of individual investigators to phenotype these same accessions for thousands of traits of interest. For example, this research has the potential for rapid advancement toward the mechanisms by which plants adapt to various climates, utilize soil nutrients and resist pathogen infection. The knowledgebase produced from the 1,001 Arabidopsis Genomes Project will yield direct and measurable outcomes for deployment of similar traits in economically important crops for a changing global environment. Broader Impacts of the Proposed Research The impact of this project will be in two broad areas. First, the completion of the planned research will result in important new resources for the plant biology community: large-scale information on genetic variation among closely related genotypes. The very limited availability of whole genome sequence variation information has negatively impacted a variety of research endeavors such as the understanding of adaptive evolution or the development of association mapping. All of the DNA sequence data will be made freely and easily accessible to the research community. The long-term impact of these enabling tools and technologies on agriculture and forestry is expected to be profound, providing fundamental knowledge for the construction of new plant varieties with superior agronomic traits. An equally important aspect of this program is training, which will be provided at a variety of levels, including outreach to high school and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral mentoring. Project Outcomes: Summary of results. Understanding the relationship between genotype and the resulting phenotype is one of the greatest challenges in plant biology today. Complex environments are constantly challenging a plants ability to thrive in nature forcing them to locally adapt to their surroundings. Identifying genes that are important for adaption is paramount to our understanding of complex traits and eventual translation into crop biology. A complete catalog of genetic variation that exists within the plant kingdom would be an ideal place to begin to understand all phenotypic forms but is currently unrealistic. Instead, collaboration among plant scientists has formed and initiated the 1,001 genomes project. This 24-month project aimed to identify genetic variation that exists within the Arabidopsis thaliana species. Thousands of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions have been collected from a wide range of geographical locations. Furthermore, these accessions display a broad range of phenotypes that are shared among many species within the plant kingdom. Our laboratory joined the worldwide public effort to produce 1,001 Arabidopsis thaliana genomes. We contributed 171 genomes sequences and associated structural and nucleotide sequence variation information. In addition to genetic variation, epigenetic variation is clearly an influential factor in determining phenotype. We developed methods to determine genome-wide DNA methylation profiles at single-base resolution (methylomes). Because of the recent increase in sequencing capacity/instrument run, we were able generated DNA methylome and strand-specific transcriptome information for most accessions as an additional part of our plan to capture all possible forms of variation (the methylome and transcriptomes were not part of the original aims but due to the decreasing cost of sequencing were able to carryout these studies without additional funding).

To enable the rapid exploitation of these data for functional proteomics studies, we have created a resource for the visualization of protein information and proteomic datasets for sequenced natural strains of A. thaliana.Results: The 1001 Proteomes portal can be used to visualize amino acid substitutions or non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms in individual proteins of A. thaliana based on the reference genome Col-0. We have used the available processed sequence information to analyze the conservation of known residues subject to protein phosphorylation among these natural strains. The substitution of amino acids in A. thaliana natural strains is heavily constrained and is likely a result of the conservation of functional attributes within proteins. At a practical level, we demonstrate that this information can be used to clarify ambiguously defined phosphorylation sites from phosphoproteomic studies. Protein sets of available natural variants are available for download to enable proteomic studies on these accessions. Together this information can be used to uncover the possible roles of specific amino acids in determining the structure and function of proteins in the model plant A. thaliana.

Among them, a total of 3235 DMRs are significantly associated with gene expressions and potentially heritable. 655 of the 3235 DMRs are associated with climatic variables, and we experimentally verified one of them, HEI10 (HUMAN ENHANCER OF CELL INVASION NO.10). Such epigenetic loci could be subjected to natural selection thereby affecting plant adaptation, and would be expected to be an indicator of accessions at risk. We therefore incorporated these climate-related DMRs into a gradient forest model, and found that the natural A. thaliana accessions in Southern Europe that may be most at risk under future climate change. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating DNA methylation that is independent of genetic variations, and climatic data to predict plants' vulnerability to future climate change.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have found indications that exposure to ionising radiation (IR) results in DNA methylation changes in plants. However, this phenomenon is yet to be studied across multiple generations. Furthermore, the exact role of these changes in the IR-induced plant response is still far from understood. A multigenerational set-up was used in which three generations of seven-day old Arabidopsis thaliana plants were exposed to either of the different radiation treatments (30 mGy/h, 60 mGy/h, 110 mGy/h, or 430 mGy/h) or to natural background radiation (control condition) for 14 days. The parental generation consisted of previously non-exposed plants, whereas first and second generation plants had already received a similar irradiation in the previous one or two generations, respectively. Next to whole genome methylation levels, differentially methylated regions (DMRs), including their methylation context in the three generations a were identified. Both intra- and intergenerational comparisons of the genes and transposable elements associated with the DMRs were made. Taking the methylation context into account, the highest number of changes were found for cytosines followed directly by guanine (CG methylation), whereas only limited changes in CHG methylation occurred and no changes in CHH methylation were observed. A clear increase in IR-induced DMRs was seen over the three generations that were exposed to the lowest dose rate, where generation 2 had a markedly higher number of DMRs than the previous two generations (Parent and generation 1). No significant differences in the plants exposed to the highest dose rate were found. A large number of DMRs associated with transposable elements were found, the majority of them being hypermethylated, likely leading to more genetic stability. Next to that, a significant number of DMRs were associated with promoter-associated regions or gene bodies. A functional analysis of these genes showed an enrichment for genes related to development as well as various stress responses, including DNA repair, RNA splicing, and (a)biotic stress responses. These observations indicate a role of DNA methylation in the regulation of these genes in response to IR exposure and shows a possible role for epigenetics in plant adaptation to IR over multiple generations.},

	abstract = {In plants, mammals and insects, some genes are methylated in the CG dinucleotide context, a phenomenon called gene body methylation (gbM). It has been controversial whether this phenomenon has any functional role. Here, we took advantage of the availability of 876 leaf methylomes in Arabidopsis thaliana to characterize the population frequency of methylation at the gene level and to estimate the sitefrequency spectrum of allelic states. Using a population genetics model speciﬁcally designed for epigenetic data, we found that genes with ancestral gbM are under signiﬁcant selection to remain methylated. Conversely, ancestrally unmethylated genes were under selection to remain unmethylated. Repeating the analyses at the level of individual cytosines conﬁrmed these results. Estimated selection coefﬁcients were small, on the order of 4 Nes ¼ 1.4, which is similar to the magnitude of selection acting on codon usage. We also estimated that A. thaliana is losing gbM threefold more rapidly than gaining it, which could be due to a recent reduction in the efﬁcacy of selection after a switch to selﬁng. Finally, we investigated the potential function of gbM through its link with gene expression. Across genes with polymorphic methylation states, the expression of gene body methylated alleles was consistently and signiﬁcantly higher than unmethylated alleles. Although it is difﬁcult to disentangle genetic from epigenetic effects, our work suggests that gbM has a small but measurable effect on ﬁtness, perhaps due to its association to a phenotype-like gene expression.},

Here we, describe the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern under native field, F1 and F6 generation followed by their association with phenotypes, climate and global gene expression in the three Arabidopsis thaliana populations originated at different elevation ranges of Indian West Himalaya. We show that the global methyl cytosine (mC) content is more or less similar in the three populations but differ in their distribution across genome. There was an increase in differential methylation between the populations as elevation increased. The methylation divergence was the highest between the low and the high elevation populations. The high elevation populations were hypo-methylated than the low elevation population. The methylation in the genes was associated with population specific phenotypes and climate of the region. The genes which were differentially methylated as well as differentially expressed between the low and high elevation populations were mostly related to abiotic stresses. When grown under controlled condition, there was gain of differential methylation over native condition and the maximum percent changes was observed in CHH-sequence context. Further {\textasciitilde} 99.8\% methylated cytosines were stably passed on from F1 to F6 generation.

In the present study, 241 natural accessions of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) were grown under two different temperature regimes, 16 °C and 6 °C, and growth parameters were recorded, together with metabolite profiles, to investigate the natural genome × environment effects on metabolome variation. The plasticity of metabolism, which was captured by metabolic distance measures, varied considerably between accessions. Both relative growth rates and metabolic distances were predictable by the underlying natural genetic variation of accessions. Applying machine learning methods, climatic variables of the original growth habitats were tested for their predictive power of natural metabolic variation among accessions. We found specifically habitat temperature during the first quarter of the year to be the best predictor of the plasticity of primary metabolism, indicating habitat temperature as the causal driver of evolutionary cold adaptation processes. Analyses of epigenome- and genome-wide associations revealed accession-specific differential DNA-methylation levels as potentially linked to the metabolome and identified FUMARASE2 as strongly associated with cold adaptation in Arabidopsis accessions. These findings were supported by calculations of the biochemical Jacobian matrix based on variance and covariance of metabolomics data, which revealed that growth under low temperatures most substantially affects the accession-specific plasticity of fumarate and sugar metabolism. Our findings indicate that the plasticity of metabolic regulation is predictable from the genome and epigenome and driven evolutionarily by Arabidopsis growth habitats.},

	abstract = {Failure to maintain DNA methylation patterns during plant development can occasionally give rise to so-called “spontaneous epimutations”. These stochastic methylation changes are sometimes heritable across generations and thus accumulate in plant genomes over time. Recent evidence indicates that spontaneous epimutations have a major role in shaping patterns of methylation diversity in plant populations. Using single CG dinucleotides as units of analysis, previous work has shown that the epimutation rate is several orders of magnitude higher than the genetic mutation rate. While these large rate differences have obvious implications for understanding genome-methylome co-evolution, the functional relevance of single CG methylation changes remains questionable. In contrast to single CG, solid experimental evidence has linked methylation gains and losses in larger genomic regions with transcriptional variation and heritable phenotypic effects. Here we show that such region-level changes arise stochastically at about the same rate as those at individual CG sites, are only marginal dependent on region size and cytosine density, but strongly dependent on chromosomal location. We also find consistent evidence that region-level epimutations are not restricted to CG contexts but also frequently occur in non-CG regions at the genome-wide scale. Taken together, our results support the view that many differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in natural populations originate from epimutation events and may not be effectively tagged by proximal SNPs. This possibility reinforces the need for epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) in plants as a way to identify the epigenetic basis of complex traits.},

	abstract = {Salt stress threatens plant growth, development and crop yields, and has become a critical global environmental issue. Increasing evidence has suggested that the epigenetic mechanism such as DNA methylation can mediate plant response to salt stress through transcriptional regulation and transposable element (TE) silencing. However, studies exploring genome-wide methylation dynamics under salt stress remain limited, in particular, for studies on multiple genotypes. Here, we adopted four natural accessions of the model species Arabidopsis thaliana and investigated the phenotypic and genome-wide methylation responses to salt stress through whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). We found that salt stress significantly changed plant phenotypes, including plant height, rosette diameter, fruit number, and aboveground biomass, and the change in biomass tended to depend on accessions. Methylation analysis revealed that genome-wide methylation patterns depended primarily on accessions, and salt stress caused significant methylation changes in {\textasciitilde} 0.1\% cytosines over the genomes. 33.5\% of these salt-induced differential methylated cytosines (DMCs) were located to TEs. These salt-induced DMCs were mainly hypermethylated and accession-specific. TEs annotated to have DMCs (DMC-TEs) across accessions were found mostly belonged to the superfamily of Gypsy, a type II transposon, indicating a convergent DMC dynamic on TEs across different genetic backgrounds. Moreover, 8.0\% of salt-induced DMCs were located in gene bodies and their proximal regulatory regions. These DMCs were also accession-specific, and genes annotated to have DMCs (DMC-genes) appeared to be more accession-specific than DMC-TEs. Intriguingly, both accession-specific DMC-genes and DMC-genes shared by multiple accessions were enriched in similar functions, including methylation, gene silencing, chemical homeostasis, polysaccharide catabolic process, and pathways relating to shifts between vegetative growth and reproduction. These results indicate that, across different genetic backgrounds, methylation changes may have convergent functions in post-transcriptional, physiological, and phenotypic modulation under salt stress. These convergent methylation dynamics across accession may be autonomous from genetic variation or due to convergent genetic changes, which requires further exploration. Our study provides a more comprehensive picture of genome-wide methylation dynamics under salt stress, and highlights the importance of exploring stress response mechanisms from diverse genetic backgrounds.},

              Background and Aims
              The observed positive diversity effect on ecosystem functioning has rarely been assessed in terms of intraspecific trait variability within populations. Intraspecific phenotypic variability could stem both from underlying genetic diversity and from plasticity in response to environmental cues. The latter might derive from modifications to a plant’s epigenome and potentially last multiple generations in response to previous environmental conditions. We experimentally disentangled the role of genetic diversity and diversity of parental environments on population productivity, resistance against environmental fluctuations and intraspecific phenotypic variation.
            
            
              Methods
              A glasshouse experiment was conducted in which different types of Arabidopsis thaliana populations were established: one population type with differing levels of genetic diversity and another type, genetically identical, but with varying diversity levels of the parental environments (parents grown in the same or different environments). The latter population type was further combined, or not, with experimental demethylation to reduce the potential epigenetic diversity produced by the diversity of parental environments. Furthermore, all populations were each grown under different environmental conditions (control, fertilization and waterlogging). Mortality, productivity and trait variability were measured in each population.
            
            
              Key Results
              Parental environments triggered phenotypic modifications in the offspring, which translated into more functionally diverse populations when offspring from parents grown under different conditions were brought together in mixtures. In general, neither the increase in genetic diversity nor the increase in diversity of parental environments had a remarkable effect on productivity or resistance to environmental fluctuations. However, when the epigenetic variation was reduced via demethylation, mixtures were less productive than monocultures (i.e. negative net diversity effect), caused by the reduction of phenotypic differences between different parental origins.
            
            
              Conclusions
              A diversity of environmental parental origins within a population could ameliorate the negative effect of competition between coexisting individuals by increasing intraspecific phenotypic variation. A diversity of parental environments could thus have comparable effects to genetic diversity. Disentangling the effect of genetic diversity and that of parental environments appears to be an important step in understanding the effect of intraspecific trait variability on coexistence and ecosystem functioning.},

	abstract = {In plants and mammals, DNA methylation plays a critical role in transcriptional silencing by delineating heterochromatin from transcriptionally active euchromatin. A homeostatic balance between heterochromatin and euchromatin is essential to genomic stability. This is evident in many diseases and mutants for heterochromatin maintenance, which are characterized by global losses of DNA methylation coupled with localized ectopic gains of DNA methylation that alter transcription. Furthermore, we have shown that genome-wide methylation patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana are highly stable over generations, with the exception of rare epialleles. However, the extent to which natural variation in the robustness of targeting DNA methylation to heterochromatin exists, and the phenotypic consequences of such variation, remain to be fully explored. Here we describe the finding that heterochromatin and genic DNA methylation are highly variable among 725 A. thaliana accessions. We found that genic DNA methylation is inversely correlated with that in heterochromatin, suggesting that certain methylation pathway(s) may be redirected to genes upon the loss of heterochromatin. This redistribution likely involves a feedback loop involving the DNA methyltransferase, CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3), H3K9me2, and histone turnover, as highly expressed, long genes with a high density of CMT3-preferred CWG sites are more likely to be methylated. Importantly, although the presence of CG methylation in genes alone may not affect transcription, genes containing CG methylation are more likely to become methylated at non-CG sites and silenced. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that natural variation in DNA methylation homeostasis may underlie the evolution of epialleles that alter phenotypes.},

By conducting a genome-wide analysis of transcription start sites (TSSs) using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) sequencing, we show that thousands of TSSs are exclusively activated in various epigenetic mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana and referred to as cryptic TSSs. Many have not been identified in previous studies, of which up to 65\% are contributed by transposons. They possess similar genetic features to regular TSSs and their activation is strongly associated with the ectopic recruitment of RNAPII machinery. The activation of cryptic TSSs significantly alters transcription of nearby TSSs, including those of genes important for development and stress responses. Our study, therefore, sheds light on the role of epigenetic regulation in maintaining proper gene functions in plants by suppressing transcription from cryptic TSSs.},

Plant genomes are widely methylated, and the methylation generally occurs on the cytosine bases through the activity of specific enzymes called DNA methyltransferases. On the other hand, methylated DNA can also undergo demethylation through the action of demethylases. The methylation landscape is finely tuned and assumes a pivotal role in plant development and evolution. This review illustrates different molecular aspects of DNA methylation and some plant physiological processes influenced by this epigenetic modification in model species, crops, and ornamental plants such as orchids. In addition, this review aims to describe the relationship between the changes in plant DNA methylation levels and the response to biotic and abiotic stress. Finally, we discuss the possible evolutionary implications and biotechnological applications of DNA methylation.},

Overall, the findings support the hypothesis that the sperm DNA methylation is associated with sperm alterations and infertility. Several genes have been found to be differentially methylated in relation to impaired spermatogenesis and/or reproductive dysfunction. Particularly, DNA methylation defects of MEST and H19 within imprinted genes and MTHFR within non-imprinted genes, have been repeatedly linked with male infertility. The deep knowledge of sperm DNA methylation status in association with the reduced reproductive potential could improve the development of novel diagnostic tools for this disease.

For this purpose, whole-genome sequencing of sodium bisulfite-treated DNA was performed. The analysis was performed at seven time points, taking into account the control conditions, heat stress, and recovery to control conditions after the stress treatment was discontinued. In our study we observed decrease in the level of DNA methylation under the influence of heat stress, especially after returning to control conditions. Analysis of the gene ontology enrichment and regulatory pathways showed that genes characterized by differential DNA methylation are mainly associated with stress response, including heat stress. These are the genes encoding heat shock proteins and genes associated with translation regulation. A decrease in the level of DNA methylation in such specific sites suggests that under the influence of heat stress we observe active demethylation phenomenon rather than passive demethylation, which is not locus specific.},

However, the effects of increasing environmental temperature on plant mutation rates and relative impact on specific mutational classes (e.g., insertion/deletion [indel] vs. single nucleotide variant [SNV]) are unknown. This topic is important because of the poorly defined effects of anthropogenic global temperature rise on biological systems. Here, we show the impact of temperature increase on Arabidopsis thaliana mutation, studying whole genome profiles of mutation accumulation (MA) lineages grown for 11 successive generations at 29°C. Whereas growth of A. thaliana at standard temperature (ST; 23°C) is associated with a mutation rate of 7 × 10−9 base substitutions per site per generation, growth at stressful high temperature (HT; 29°C) is highly mutagenic, increasing the mutation rate to 12 × 10−9. SNV frequency is approximately two- to threefold higher at HT than at ST, and HT-growth causes an ∼19- to 23-fold increase in indel frequency, resulting in a disproportionate increase in indels (vs. SNVs). Most HT-induced indels are 1–2 bp in size and particularly affect homopolymeric or dinucleotide A or T stretch regions of the genome. HT-induced indels occur disproportionately in nucleosome-free regions, suggesting that much HT-induced mutational damage occurs during cell-cycle phases when genomic DNA is packaged into nucleosomes. We conclude that stressful experimental temperature increases accelerate plant mutation rates and particularly accelerate the rate of indel mutation. Increasing environmental temperatures are thus likely to have significant mutagenic consequences for plants growing in the wild and may, in particular, add detrimentally to mutational load.},

	abstract = {Plants are sedentary organisms that constantly sense changes in their environment and react to various environmental cues. On a short-time scale, plants respond through alterations in their physiology, and on a long-timescale, plants alter their development and pass on the memory of stress to the progeny. The latter is controlled genetically and epigenetically and allows the progeny to be primed for future stress encounters, thus increasing the likelihood of survival. The current study intended to explore the effects of multigenerational heat stress in Arabidopsis thaliana. 25 generations of Arabidopsis thaliana were propagated in the presence of heat stress. The multigenerational stressed lineage F25H exhibited a higher tolerance compared to control progeny F25C. F25H stressed progeny also exhibited the elevated frequency of homologous recombination. A comparison of genomic sequences revealed that F25H lineage had a three-fold higher number of mutations (SNPs and INDELs) as compared to the parallel (F25C) and parental (F2C seeds used as parental control because F1C and F0 generations seeds were no more viable) lineages, suggesting that heat stress induced genetic variations in the heat-stressed progeny. The F25H stressed progeny showed a 7-fold higher number of non-synonymous mutations than the parental non-stress line which might lead to biological variations. Methylome analysis revealed that the F25H stressed progeny showed a lower global methylation level in the CHH context than the control progeny. The F25H and F25C lineages were different from the parental control lineage F2C by 66,491and 80,464 differentially methylated positions (DMPs), respectively, indicating that many epigenetic variations were likely spontaneous in nature. F25H stressed progeny displayed higher frequency of methylation changes in the gene body and lower in the body of Transposable Elements (TEs). Gene Ontology analysis revealed that CG-DMRs were enriched in processes such as response to abiotic and biotic stimulus, cell organizations and biogenesis, and DNA or RNA metabolism. Hierarchical clustering of these epimutations separated the heat stressed and control parental progenies into distinct groups which revealed the non-random nature of epimutations. Overall, our study showed that progenies derived from multigenerational heat stress displayed a notable adaption in context of phenotypic, genotypic and epigenotypic resilience.},

	abstract = {The exposure to environmental stress can trigger epigenetic variation, which may have several evolutionary consequences. Polyploidy seems to affect the DNA methylation profiles. Nevertheless, it abides unclear whether temperature stress can induce methylations changes in different cytotypes and to what extent a treatment shift is translated to an epigenetic response. A suitable model system for studying these questions is Ranunculus kuepferi, an alpine perennial herb.Diploid and tetraploid individuals of R. kuepferi were exposed to cold [+7°C day/+2°C night; frost treatment: -1°C cold shocks for three nights per week ] and warm [+15° day/+10°C night ] conditions in climate growth chambers for two consecutive flowering periods and shifted from one condition to the other after the first flowering period. Methylation-sensitive amplified fragment-length polymorphism markers were applied for both years, to track down possible alterations induced by the stress treatments. Patterns of methylation suggested that cytotypes differed significantly in their profiles, independent from year of treatment. Likewise, the treatment shift had an impact on both cytotypes, resulting in significantly less epiloci, regardless the shift’s direction. The AMOVAs reflect the DNA methylation dynamics of tetraploids, as a response to temperature’s change, and follow up the hypothesis of cold stress affecting the epigenetic variation. Results suggest that the temperature-sensitivity of DNA methylation patterns shows a highly dynamic phenotypic plasticity in R. kuepferi, as both cytotypes responded to temperature shifts. Furthermore, ploidy level has an important effect on epigenetic background variation, which may be correlated with the DNA methylation dynamics during cold acclimation.},

	abstract = {Motivation
The evolution of complex diseases can be modeled as a time-dependent nonlinear dynamic system, and its progression can be divided into three states, i.e., the normal state, the pre-disease state and the disease state. The sudden deterioration of the disease can be regarded as the state transition of the dynamic system at the critical state or pre-disease state. How to detect the critical state of an individual before the disease state based on single-sample data has attracted many researchers’ attention.

Methods
In this study, we proposed a novel approach, i.e., single-sample-based Jensen-Shannon Divergence (sJSD) method to detect the early-warning signals of complex diseases before critical transitions based on individual single-sample data. The method aims to construct score index based on sJSD, namely, inconsistency index (ICI).

Results
This method is applied to five real datasets, including prostate cancer, bladder urothelial carcinoma, influenza virus infection, cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The critical states of 5 datasets with their corresponding sJSD signal biomarkers are successfully identified to diagnose and predict each individual sample, and some “dark genes” that without differential expressions but are sensitive to ICI score were revealed. This method is a data-driven and model-free method, which can be applied to not only disease prediction on individuals but also targeted drug design of each disease. At the same time, the identification of sJSD signal biomarkers is also of great significance for studying the molecular mechanism of disease progression from a dynamic perspective.},

	abstract = {Taking advantage of the high-throughput genotyping technology of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWASs) have been successfully implemented for defining the relative role of genes and the environment in disease risk, assisting in enabling preventative and precision medicine. However, current multi-locus-based methods are insufficient in terms of computational cost and discrimination power to detect statistically significant interactions with different genetic effects on multifarious diseases. Statistical tests for multi-locus interactions (\&gt;= 2 SNPs) raise huge analytical challenges because computational cost increases exponentially as the growth of the cardinality of SNPs in an interaction module. In this paper, we develop a simple, fast, and powerful method, named JS-MA, based on Jensen-Shannon divergence and agglomerative hierarchical clustering, to detect the genome-wide multi-locus interactions associated with multiple diseases. From the systematical simulation, JS-MA is more powerful and efficient compared with the state-of-the-art association mapping tools. JS-MA was applied to the real GWAS datasets for two common diseases, i.e., Rheumatoid Arthritis and Type 1 Diabetes. The results showed that JS-MA not only confirmed recently reported, biologically meaningful associations, but also identified novel multi-locus interactions. Therefore, we believe that JS-MA is suitable and efficient for a full-scale analysis of multi-disease-related interactions in the large GWASs.},

In particular, their stability becomes crucial when the feature importance is later studied in order to better understand the underlying process. The fact that a small change in the dataset may affect the outcome of the feature selection/ranking algorithm has been long overlooked in the literature. We propose an information-theoretic approach, using the Jensen-Shannon divergence to assess this stability (or robustness). Unlike other measures, this new metric is suitable for different algorithm outcomes: full ranked lists, partial sublists (top-k lists) as well as the least studied partial ranked lists. This generalized metric attempts to measure the disagreement among a whole set of lists with the same size, following a probabilistic approach and being able to give more importance to the differences that appear at the top of the list. We illustrate and compare it with popular metrics like the Spearman rank correlation and the Kuncheva’s index on feature selection/ranking outcomes artificially generated and on an spectral fat dataset with different filter-based feature selectors.},

However, existing generative models that approximate a multimodal ELBO rely on difficult or inefficient training schemes to learn a joint distribution and the dependencies between modalities.
In this work, we propose a novel, efficient objective function that utilizes the Jensen-Shannon divergence for multiple distributions. It simultaneously  approximates the unimodal and joint multimodal posteriors directly via a dynamic prior. In addition, we theoretically prove that the new multimodal JS-divergence (mmJSD) objective optimizes an ELBO.
In extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantage of the proposed mmJSD model compared to previous work in unsupervised, generative learning tasks.},
